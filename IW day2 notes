#### ElectroMagnetic Spectrum
* A manuever space essential for facilitating control within the operational environment and impacts all portions of the OE and military operations


#### Joint warfighting concept
* Developed to address the joint forces need to adapt to the changing character of war and geopolitical landscape which requires an integrated and interoperable force to demonstrate detterence
* Falls under the national defense strategy

#### Joint electromagnetic spectrum
* Military actions undertaken by a joint force to exploit, attack, protect and manage the electromagnetic environment
